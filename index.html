                <h1>PRNT SCREENSHOT FINDER</h1>
                <p>The Website <a href="https://prnt.sc/">prnt.sc</a> is a very popular website for sharing
                    screenshots. Many people don't consider that the screenshots are available for everyone through the
                    generated link. With this website you can find screenshots by only a click. There are 3 sections
                    Random, Link and Loop. Be careful some images contain nudity or scam. When you want to use the Loop
                    function you must allow pop-ups in your browser. Click on the image and try it out

                <h1>WORDLE WORDS</h1>
                <p>The popular game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> is played by
                    millions every day. Because I am not a native English speaker i often had quite some trouble to find
                    a
                    word matching the letters I already figure out. So, I built a website where you enter the letters
                    you
                    used and the website shows you all valid words and possible solutions. I usually start with ADIEU
                    btw. Click on the image and try it out</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h1>NAME TO COLOR</h1>
                <p>Ever wondered what your name would look like as a color?
                    Now you have the chance to try it out. Just enter any text and click on GO.
                    Your text will be converted into a unique color and RGBA as well as the hex value will be shown.
                    using the opacity range you can also adjust the opacity. Click on the image and try it out.

                <h1>binary Number Decomposition</h1>
                <p>Enter numbers in the textbox and hit the button. The numbers will be converted to binary, each bit
                    position is counted and converted into a new list of numbers. Click on the image and try it out.</p>

                <h1>NAME-IT-GAME</h1>
                <p>Everyone likes party games. So, I built a game that is fun and challenging at the same time.
                    a topic is given in the middle of the screen, everyone must name something fitting the topic
                    within 5 Seconds.
